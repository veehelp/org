          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana"> The Trust would like 
            to extend financial HELP to economically poor children, those who 
            are good in their studies. Our interest is to identify the most economically 
            weaker families without the feeling of caste, colour, creed or religion, 
            where the parents are sick, jobless, unable to meet their children 
            educational expenses. The Trust would extend help primarily for education 
            upto high school level. However, higher studies will be looked into 
            in a case to case basis. The child should have good academic record 
            with proper behavioural manners. </font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana">The Trust would examine 
            the background of the family and would extend support for those who 
            really deserved such assistance. The Trust own the responsibility 
            either to grant or refuse any such applications, and no demand, in 
            this connection is being entertained at whatsoever nature.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana">Interested children 
            or their parents are requested to get in touch with the Trust officials, 
            in this connection. </font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana"> <b>Eye Donation:</b><br>
            The Trust acted swiftly when the mother of one of our Volunteers passed 
            away during the month of February 2004 at a village nearby Chennai 
            city. The process was supported by the Lions Club International.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana">Both the eyes are donated. 
            The entire initiative was taken by Mr. Ravichandran timely, who is 
            a Computer professional. He is associated with HELP Movement activities 
            for the past so many years.</font></p>

            volunteers are involved in promoting Awareness programs on HIV/AIDS 
            in the society, especially in the villages. AIDS awareness camps are 
            organized in association with Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Board and we 
            bring learned speakers who can deliver valuable information about 
            HIV/AIDS so as to keep precautions. We also circulate pamphlets and 
            informative articles on AIDS in the society.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana">We are also organizing 
            free medicines for the AIDS affected poor patients. Today, most of 
            the HIV/AIDS affected patients are not willing to come forward for 
            treatment with the fear of their social status. HELP Movement recognizes 
            such situation, and would like to deliver free medicines in a confidential 
            manner, based on need. We also would like to courier such medicines, 
            provided the patients are registered with us. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial, Verdana">We therefore, request 
            HIV/AIDS affected patients to register with us for such benefits. 
            We confirm, such details will not be disclosed to anybody. <br>
            We also would intend to offer funeral assistance for HIV/AIDS patients. 
            Please get in touch with the Trust officials to do the needful</font></p>

            is one of our focused areas, as we value the sight. The importance 
            of sight will be known once we lost it. Therefore, HELP Movement initiates 
            program to identify such poor old-aged persons, and would organize 
            Cataract at a specified time. We accept registrations of such needy 
            persons, who will be intimated the date and time for such surgery 
            once we could accumulate 15-20 persons. We are dependable for such 
            treatment with other like-minded NGOs, like Lions Club International
